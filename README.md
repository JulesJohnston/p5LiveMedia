# p5.simplesimplepeer
Simple P5 WebRTC

Include this library in a p5 sketch and share audio/video streams or the canvas itself as a stream.  Can also share data (string only for now).  All WebRTC so Peer to Peer.  

Running a public signaling server on https://simplesimplepeer.itp.io - Run your own signalling server by running server.js (with Node, Express and Socket.io).  

More documentation and examples forthcoming.
